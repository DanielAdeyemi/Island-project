# Project for independent Island vacation 
### *By Daniel Adeyemi*
#### *This project was mainly created for purporse of practice with branching and merging on Git.*
1 main web site with additional pages for accomodation, activities, travel arrangements, contact information and additional pictures. I used CSS for every page independently, so they are unique. You don't need any special setup or programs and main web page can be reached through [git-hub pages](https://danieladeyemi.github.io/Island-project/) 
All pictures was taken from open source by using [Google](google.com).

*Note: style is not perfect at all. Any recomendations how to improve it could be sent me personally*
